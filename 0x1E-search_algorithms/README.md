## 0x1E. C - Search Algorithms

## 0. Linear search
A  function that searches for a value in an array of integers using the Linear search algorithm

## 1. Binary search
A  function that searches for a value in a sorted array of integers using the Binary search algorithm

##  Big O #0
indicates time complexity (worst case) of a linear search in an array of size n

##  Big O #1
Indicates  the space complexity (worst case) of an iterative linear search algorithm in an array of size n

## Big O #2
Indicates  the time complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n

##  Big O #3
Indicates the space complexity (worst case) of a binary search in an array of size n

##  Big O #4
Indicates the space complexity of this function given 

## 7. Jump search
Jump search is a searching algorithm that is used to find the position of a target value within a sorted array or list of elements. It is an improvement over linear search because it reduces the number of comparisons required to find the target element.

##  Big O #5
Indicates  the time complexity (average case) of a jump search in an array of size n, using step = sqrt(n)

## 9.  Interpolation search
Interpolation search is an efficient searching algorithm used to find the position of a specific target value within a sorted array of elements. Unlike binary search, which always divides the search range in half, interpolation search uses a more sophisticated approach based on the values of the elements themselves. It makes a reasonable guess about where the target value might be located and adjusts its search accordingly. This makes it particularly useful when the data distribution within the array is uneven.

## 10. Exponential search 
Exponential search is a searching algorithm used to find the position of a specific target value within a sorted array or list of elements. It is similar in concept to binary search but differs in its approach to narrowing down the search range.
